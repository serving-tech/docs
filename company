Navigation Flow

Unauthenticated: Login → Dashboard
Authenticated: Sidebar navigates to Dashboard, Clients, Locations, Users, Staff, Sessions, History, Financials, Analytics, Notifications, Settings, Support, Logout

Technical Considerations

Framework: React SPA, Tailwind CSS for responsive styling.
API: Secure HTTP requests, token refresh on 401 errors.
Storage: localStorage for JWT tokens, secure session management.
Real-time: Polling for sessions/notifications, future WebSocket support.
Export Libraries: Client-side PDF/CSV generation (e.g., pdfmake, PapaParse).
Responsive Design: Tailwind responsive classes, fluid typography, flexible grids.
Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, WCAG 2.1, accessible PDF exports.
Localization: English/Swahili, Kenyan phone formats.

Data Manipulation

Clients: View, edit, delete (CompanyClientDetailAPIView).
Locations: View, edit, delete (CompanyLocationDetailAPIView).
Users: View, edit (CompanyUserDetailAPIView).
Staff: Create, view, edit, delete (CompanyStaffAPIView, CompanyStaffDetailAPIView).
Support: Create, update tickets (CompanySupportAPIView).
Exports: PDF/CSV for all data-heavy screens, respecting filters.

Integration with Mobile App

Consistency: Shared branding (logo, colors, typography) with mobile app.
Data Flow: Mobile app’s external system (car detection, payments, exits) updates dashboard’s sessions, financials, and analytics in real-time.
Admin Power: Dashboard supports full CRUD and exports, unlike mobile app’s read-heavy focus.

Future Enhancements

Detailed client/location/user views (implement GET /api/company/clients/{client_id}, etc.).
Alert resolution endpoint.
Advanced settings (e.g., fee structures).
Multi-language support.
